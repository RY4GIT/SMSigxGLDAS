Data from multiple sensors that are in one satellite grid are weight-averaged based on the area. 

The weighted averaged sensors are as follows. 

[Oznet]
sensor id 32 and 34 (weight-averaged dataset is denoted as 32 in the new dataset) ... moderate seasonality

[SCAN]
sensor id 37, 38, and 39 (denoted as 37) ... unclear seasonality, NOT included in the seasonal signature calculation
sensor id 9, 85, and 86 (denoted as 9) ... clear seasonality
sensor id 40 and 42 (denoted as 40) ... clear seasonality
sensor id 71 and 72 (denoted as 71)  ... clear seasonality

[USCRN]
sensor id 8 and 9 (denoted as 8) ... unclear seasonality, NOT included in the seasonal signature calculation
sensor id 27 and 28 (denoted as 27) ... with clear seasonality
